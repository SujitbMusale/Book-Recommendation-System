# Book-Recommendation-System
This is unsupervised Machine Learning Project
The initial step,of our project was Data preprocessing of the three datasets-books_df,users_df and ratings_df,wherein we removed duplicates and imputed the missing values & invalid entries with appropriate values,corrected spellings. Then,we performed Exploratory Data Analysis to find out the countries with maximum users,popular books,popular authors and popular publishing companies.We also analysed the rating distribution,age distribution of users and the popular books amongst various age groups . Then,we used Popularity-based approach,Collaborative filtering approach to built different types of recommendation models. *We evaluated the performance of Singular Value Decomposition based recommender and obtained a Global Recall@5 of 30 % and Recall@10 of 41%.
